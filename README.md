# MoviePool Client

### What is this about?
This MoviePool Client was built as a task for Achievement 3 in [Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). <br>
It is based on its existing server-side code [RESTful API and database](https://github.com/EllyPirelly/cf-movie-api) and is the "R" part of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) which was a general requirement. It's the client-side.

- must be a single-page application (SPA)
- must use state routing to navigate between views and share URLs
